# The Guardian - Proof of Stake Consensus Protocol (idea)

### Guardian is an open source multichain platform and proof-of-stake consensus protocol to preventing pandemics. 


### Free the globe from pandemic

We have to save the world. Peoples is dying in front of our eyes. And without community, there is no humanity. If we want to breathe, we need t healthier environment, trees, clean air, energy, water, electricity, better recycling and plastic waste, If we want nature around us, we have to maintain the “circle of life”. If there is no habitat for animals to live in, it affects not only them – it affects us! Fires, floods , hurricanes, droughts, air pollution, human-to-human diseases and viruses – and the list goes on, very long and expands day by day. In each of these cases, nature shows us clearly that it doesn’t need people. However, people need nature, community and will always need it.

### Crowdsale Platform

Multiple tokens can be distributed in a variety of ways, and one popular method is holding a crowdsale, like an initial coin offering (ICO) and Security Token Offering (STO). Crowdsales are a way for a company or societies to raise capital for the help crisis or business by creating our own token is ERC-20 standard token that can be purchased with cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum’s native currency. Whenever a crowdsale takes place, a company gets liquid capital in the form of ether that was paid in by investors in exchange for the token. The company is also able to reserve some amount of ERC-20 tokens that were sold in the crowdsale.

In order to participate, an investor must connect to the ethereum blockchain with an account. This account has a wallet address that can store ether, as well as the ERC 20 tokens that are purchased in the crowdsale. The investor must visit a crowdsale website that talks to a smart contract, and this smart contract governs all the rules about how crowdsale works. Whenever an investor purchases tokens on the crowdsale website, they send ether to a smart contract, and smart contract instantly dispensers the tokens that they purchased to their wallet.
